Vadim Bryskin is one of the pioneers of visual holography, he presents a series of fine and artistic holograms that demonstrate the high level of achievements of the Russian school of holography.

The presented holograms were made from the beginning of the 1980s of the last century and show the stages of development of visual holography. If at the beginning of its development these were mainly holograms-copies of museum exhibits, then later holograms for advertising, holograms-design for interior decoration and, finally, holographic portrait appeared.

Vadim Bryskin was born in 1950 in St. Petersburg. After graduation from the Leningrad Electrotechnical Institute (LETI). IN AND. Ulyanov-Lenin since 1973 worked in the State Optical Institute. SI Vavilov (GOI) under the guidance of Yu.N. Denisyuk - the author of three-dimensional reflective holography, academician of the Russian Academy of Sciences.

In 1990, Vadim Bryskin organized powerful holographic production at the Leningrad Art Glass Factory, and in 1992 he opened the world's first holographic studio, working for a man from the street, where everyone could order his holographic portrait. Atelier was located on the main street of St. Petersburg - Nevsky Prospekt. According to the well-known experts - holographs of the world, portraits made in this studio - ateliers were the best in the world in quality.

The joint work of Vadim Bryskin and the artist Alexander Prostev from the late 80's fruitfully affected the development of a new direction in art - artistic holography. Holograms made by them, were successfully acquired by connoisseurs of art in different countries of the world.

Over the years, many exhibitions around the world took place, where holograms produced by a team of specialists led by Vadim Bryskin were displayed. And everywhere they caused admiration from the audience. Their high quality constantly confirmed the priority of the Russian school of holography, created by an outstanding scientist - Yu.N. Denisyuk.

The work of Vadim Bryskin with the famous museums of St. Petersburg - the Hermitage, the Kunstkamera of Peter I, the Museum of Ethnography, etc., has widely demonstrated the possibilities of using holography in the museum business.

Art holography opens new possibilities in interior design. Using a holographic image in advertising enhances the effect of perception by the viewer. Holographic portrait can not be underestimated. Today it is a premise in the future of your image.

Unfortunately, despite the fact that holography as a science has been developing for over 35 years, many people in the world know little about it.

** A series of holograms is proposed for the organization of the exhibition in order to acquaint viewers with the history of the development of visual holography, the principles of the holographic method, the possibilities of using holography. **

Perhaps, one of the viewers will see unique exhibits from the collections of famous museums of the world for the first time, and someone will certainly want to leave a memory in the form of a holographic image about themselves or about people close to them, animals.
